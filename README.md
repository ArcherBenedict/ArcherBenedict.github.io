## Hello and welcome to my Github Page!
![ArcherBenedictPhoto](https://github.com/ArcherBenedict/ArcherBenedict.github.io/blob/main/February%2010th,%202024%204.JPEG?raw=true)
My name is Archer Benedict, and I am a student at Lehigh University. At Lehigh I am also a member of the Brown and White, so if you'd like to check out any of my articles you can find them [here](https://thebrownandwhite.com/?s=archer+benedict). I have been named a Dean's List Scholar at Lehigh for all 3 of the semesters I have attended, and I am currently the head editor of the Opinion section of the Brown and White. Here I have posted all of the graphics and visualizations that I have created in my data journalism class. These graphics represent everything from the history of the Lehigh vs Laf football rivalry to all the cities Oliva Rodrigo will visit on her GUTS tour. Please enjoy the many graphics I have created for this page, and try to see how my graph creation skills have progressed since the beginning of the year. 

### Student Loan Infographic

This is the first infopgraphic I made for this course. It breaks down the data from (https://educationdata.org/) to give viewers a better idea of the distrobution of financial aid. All the graphics here are pretty basic, but the purpose was to experiment with Canva's graphic tool and to create different kinds of visualizations using the same data on the same graphic. 

### LeLaf Rivalry Timeline

This timeline uses images from Lehigh archives and information from the LeLaf Rivalry Wiki page. Anyone associated with these two schools knows that this rivalry is the most played rivialy in all of college football, dating all the way back to Oct 25th 1884. I capture a few key moments in the rivalry, up until the COVID Cancelation of 2020. You can really start to see some development in my use of images and technical skills, even if the timeline only has a few entires. 

### Olivia Rodrigo GUTS tour city map

I am a huge O-Rod fan so when we were tasked with making a visualization map I knew that I was going to center it around her GUTS tour. The data here was all manually put into a google sheet after I looked up all the cities found their coordinates. It definitely took a lot longer to create the map this way, but it was worth it to see all the stops Olivia is taking on her tour. PS: if you find stop #26 you'll know which concert I am going to this year. The answer might surprise you.   

### 2023 NFL Playoff QBR 
![2023_NFL_Playoff_QBR_Playoff_QBR_chartbuilder](https://github.com/ArcherBenedict/ArcherBenedict.github.io/assets/160147428/519ada54-c8a3-4df0-b24c-3537672fd068)
This graph uses data from statmuse.com to compare the highest QBR of last years NFL playoffs. Most football fans would be able to recognize Jauan Jennings is a wide receiver and is out of place on this graph. However, he delivered a touchdown pass in Superbowl 58 which makes his passing statline 1 for 1 with a touchdown, beating out elite QBs like Jordan Love and Matt Stafford. As much as this graph is technically true, it goes to show how easy it is to mislead viewers with inforgraphics that lack context. Looking at this graphic alone you could say tath Jennings was the best QB in last years playoff, but adding something as simple as a minimum of 2 pass attempts to the criteria would prove that statment invalid.

This infographic uses data from Lehigh to compare the perferred party location of students, broken down into gender and social groups. This was our classes first time using Tableau and it can be a very helpful in creating graphics, but the interface can be overwhelming.

This is the first graphic I created on Tableau without input from the class. It compares the percentage of students reciving the Federal Pell grant at HBCUs and non-HBCUs
